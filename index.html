          <p>
          	TypeMotion is a bookmarklet that provides you with information about the tpographic rythm on any page. <a href="javascript:(function(){var a=document.createElement('script'),b=document.createElement('script');a.src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js';b.src='http://y-lohse.github.io/TypeMotion/typemotion.js?'+Math.floor((new Date)/(864e5));document.body.appendChild(a);document.body.appendChild(b);})(document);">Try it out on this page</a>.<br />
          	You can also live adjust the rythm by clicking on any paragraph and control the <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>word-spacing</code> properties. Supports incrementing and decrementing with arrow keys.
          </p>

          	If you want to create the bookmarklet manually, here's the code :

          	"He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder. "But come, it's getting dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes—it's a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There's plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed "I vum it's Sunday—you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come to anchor somewhere—come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?"
		  </p>
			
		  <p>
			I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.
		  </p>
			
		  <p>
			"There," said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; "there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye." I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
		  </p>
			
		  <p>
			Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
